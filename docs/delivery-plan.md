## 1. The Bigger Picture

**What we're building.** Fair N Square is an open-source, free expense-splitting app (a Splitwise
alternative) built deliberately with enterprise-grade architecture. There are **two intertwined
goals**, and it's important to keep them distinct:

1. **Product goal** — ship a genuinely useful expense splitter: groups, friends, expenses, splits,
   balances, settle-up, debt simplification.
2. **Learning goal** — practice building complex systems with real boundaries: a React BFF, a
   separate Auth service and Core service, gRPC/connectRPC, Postgres, CI/CD, and observability —
   deployed for real on free tiers.

These goals pull in opposite directions on speed. The strategy below resolves that tension: **honor
the real architecture, but cut a thin vertical slice through it first**, then harden and widen.

Source ADRs: [`../design/records/2-system-design-v1.md`](../design/records/2-system-design-v1.md),
[`../design/records/5-use-react-for-frontend.md`](../design/records/5-use-react-for-frontend.md),
[`../design/records/4-use-workos-for-auth.md`](../design/records/4-use-workos-for-auth.md).

### Where we are today

Already **done** (per Jira FNS):

- ✅ Local dev environment, tooling (Go, Node, Docker) — *FNS-2*
- ✅ Third-party service selection — revised to **WorkOS, Postgres, AWS** (orig. Better Auth/Fly.io) — *FNS-3*
- ✅ Repository & proto repository structure — *FNS-4*
- ✅ Auth service project scaffold — *FNS-8*
- ✅ SvelteKit project setup — *FNS-15* *(to be re-scaffolded on React, ADR-5)*
- ✅ Authentication UI (login/signup screens) — *FNS-16*

In short: **scaffolding exists; no end-to-end feature works yet.** The Auth flow isn't wired to a
real backend, the Core service hasn't been created, and there's no database schema or deployment.

---

## 2. MVP Definition

**MVP thesis:** *A user can sign up, connect with friends, create a group, record shared expenses
(split equally / by exact amounts / by percentage), see who owes whom, simplify the debts, and
settle up — running on the real two-service gRPC architecture, deployed publicly.*

If that loop works end-to-end and is deployed, the MVP is a success. Everything else is sequencing.

### In scope for MVP

| Area | Included |
| --- | --- |
| **Identity** | Google login via WorkOS AuthKit, sessions in the BFF, basic profile |
| **Authorization** | **Simple ownership/membership checks** (am I a member of this group?). *Not* full ReBAC. |
| **Social graph** | Friend requests (pending/accepted/rejected), groups, add/remove members |
| **Expenses** | Add/edit/delete expense; split **equal / exact / percentage**; notes |
| **Money** | Balance engine (who owes whom), settle-up, **debt simplification** |
| **Multi-currency** | Record expenses in different currencies with conversion *(MVP-Features stage)* |
| **Attachments & comments** | Receipt photo/PDF upload + comments on expenses *(MVP-Features stage)* |
| **Group todos** | Group todo lists with task assignment *(MVP-Features stage)* |
| **Platform** | Containerized, deployed to AWS (ECS Fargate), basic logging + health checks, core E2E tests |

> The bottom four rows were explicitly requested as part of the MVP. They are real work, so they're
> sequenced into a dedicated **MVP-Features** stage *after* the core money loop is proven — they
> extend the core rather than block it.

### Explicitly OUT of MVP (deferred to Post-MVP)

- Full fine-grained authorization / ReBAC (OpenFGA / Permit.io) — MVP uses simple membership checks
- Distributed tracing, full metrics dashboards, alerting/on-call, SLAs
- Advanced reporting, analytics, CSV/PDF export
- Transaction categories
- Push notifications, in-app chat
- Native mobile apps, offline support, MCP server for AI agents
- Performance/load testing, formal security audit & penetration testing

### MVP success criteria

- Multiple real users can sign up and use the system end-to-end.
- The full money loop (expense → balance → simplify → settle) is correct and verifiable.
- The app is publicly reachable, mobile-responsive, and survives a redeploy.
- Core flows are covered by automated E2E tests in CI.

## 3. Delivery Stages

Stages are ordered by dependency. Each ends at a **checkpoint** you can demo. Stages 0–6 constitute
the MVP; P1–P3 are post-MVP.

### Stage 0 — Foundation completion *(unblocks everything)*
Finish the plumbing the rest of the work stands on.

- **Repo hygiene** (see [`./repos.md`](./repos.md)): create **`core`** (fold in `ledger`), create **`infra`**, rename `apis` → `proto`, archive/delete the dead/legacy repos. `auth-api` is still a verbatim "Go API Template" — treat Stage 1 as greenfield there.
- Database setup: Auth DB + Core DB schemas, migration tooling (Drizzle/goose), connection pooling — *FNS-5*
- Core service scaffold: Go project, gRPC/connectRPC server, proto layout, DB wiring — *FNS-25*
- CI/CD: build + test + lint pipelines per service in GitHub Actions — *FNS-6*
- Local stack: `docker-compose` for Postgres + services for local dev — *FNS-601 (partial)*

**Checkpoint:** every service builds in CI; `docker-compose up` brings the stack up locally with empty DBs.

### Stage 1 — Auth & Identity *(MVP)*
Make login real and give the Core service a trusted user context.

- WorkOS AuthKit integration in the React BFF: Google login, session management — *FNS-9, FNS-11*
- User profile CRUD in Auth service + profile UI — *FNS-10, FNS-17*
- M2M token service so Core can call Auth on behalf of users; JWK hosting/validation — *FNS-13*
- Core ↔ Auth integration layer: token validation middleware, user context — *FNS-26*

**Checkpoint:** a user signs up, logs in, edits their profile; Core can validate a request's identity.

### Stage 2 — Groups & Friends *(MVP)*
Build the social graph the money sits on top of.

- Friends backend (request/accept/reject model — see [`../design/agentic/friendship_db_design.md`](../design/agentic/friendship_db_design.md)) + UI — *FNS-28, FNS-20*
- Groups backend (CRUD, membership, settings, soft-delete) + UI — *FNS-27, FNS-19*

**Checkpoint:** a user adds a friend and creates a group with members.

### Stage 3 — Expenses & Splitting *(MVP core)*
The heart of the product. **Single currency** at this stage.

- Expense backend: CRUD, split logic for equal / exact / percentage, validation, history — *FNS-29*
- Expense UI: add/edit/delete form, split selector, detail view, list with filters — *FNS-21*
- Reuse the split algorithm in [`../algo/Split algorithm .pdf`](../algo/) — verify with unit tests.

**Checkpoint:** a member adds an expense to a group and the split is computed and stored correctly.

### Stage 4 — Balances & Settlement *(MVP core — closes the loop)*
- Ledger + balance engine: who-owes-whom, group & per-user balances — *FNS-30*
- Settlement + debt-simplification algorithm; settle-up flow — *FNS-31*
- Balance & settlement UI: group balances, simplify visualization, settle-up, history — *FNS-22*

**🏁 Milestone — MVP Core / Alpha:** the entire money loop works end-to-end on the real architecture.

### Stage 5 — MVP Feature Completion *(MVP)*
The additionally-requested MVP features, layered onto the proven core.

- **Multi-currency:** per-expense currency + conversion in the ledger/balance engine — *extends FNS-29, FNS-30*
- **Attachments & comments:** file storage selection (extends *FNS-3/102*), receipt upload, comments — *extends FNS-29, FNS-21*
- **Group todos:** todo lists + task assignment backend + UI — *FNS-32, FNS-23*

> Recommended priority within this stage: multi-currency → attachments/comments → todos. Todos and
> attachments can slip past launch without breaking the core promise, so treat them as the trim.

**Checkpoint:** expenses in mixed currencies balance correctly; receipts attach; group todos work.

### Stage 6 — Production Readiness *(MVP launch)*
> **Deployment target: AWS** (the learning track), provisioned with **OpenTofu** — see
> [`./aws-architecture.md`](./aws-architecture.md). The MVP runs the minimal slice of that design
> (ECS Fargate + one public ALB + Cloud Map + one RDS Postgres); the async/distributed pieces land in P1.
> Fly.io remains a valid simpler fallback.

- Containerize all services; finalize multi-stage Docker builds — *FNS-601*
- Production infra on AWS via OpenTofu: ECS Fargate cluster, ALB + ACM + Route 53, RDS Postgres (2 DBs), VPC + endpoints, ECR — *FNS-602 (re-scoped to AWS)*
- Env/secrets management for dev/staging/prod (SSM Parameter Store / Secrets Manager) — *FNS-603*
- Deployment automation + rollback: GitHub Actions + OIDC, `tofu plan`/`apply`, ECS circuit-breaker — *FNS-604*
- Baseline security: rate limiting, input validation, CORS, TLS everywhere — *FNS-703, FNS-702 (partial)*
- Minimal observability: structured logging + health checks/uptime — *FNS-501, FNS-502 (partial)*
- Core test coverage: unit tests for split/ledger + E2E for critical journeys in CI — *FNS-57, FNS-59*

**🏁 Milestone — MVP Launch:** publicly deployed, monitored at a basic level, core flows tested.

## 4. Post-MVP Stages

### P1 — Hardening & Enterprise Architecture
The "learning goal" features that don't block launch but are the point of the project.
See [`./aws-architecture.md`](./aws-architecture.md) §5 and §8 for the full distributed-system track.

- **Async / event-driven** (the real distributed leap): EventBridge + SQS + a Worker for balance recalculation & debt simplification, with DLQ + idempotency — *extends FNS-30/31*
- **S3 pre-signed receipt uploads** + **SNS** notification fan-out — *extends FNS-29*
- Full fine-grained authorization / ReBAC with OpenFGA or Permit.io — *FNS-12*
- Distributed tracing (ADOT → X-Ray) + full metrics dashboards + alerting — *FNS-37, FNS-36, FNS-38*
- Full test pyramid: integration tests, broader E2E, UAT — *FNS-58, FNS-60, FNS-61*
- Security audit, security testing (SAST/DAST), compliance docs — *FNS-46, FNS-49, FNS-50*
- Performance/load testing baseline — *FNS-39, FNS-904*

### P2 — Advanced Product Features
- Advanced reporting + analytics + CSV/PDF export — *FNS-52*
- Transaction categories — *FNS-53*
- Push notifications (Firebase/OneSignal) — *FNS-54*

### P3 — Reach
- Native mobile apps (Flutter/React Native), offline support — *FNS-804*
- MCP server for AI agents

## 5. Critical Path & Sequencing Notes

```
Stage 0 ──► Stage 1 ──► Stage 2 ──► Stage 3 ──► Stage 4 ──► [Alpha]
                                                   │
                                                   ├─► Stage 5 (features)
                                                   └─► Stage 6 (launch) ──► [MVP Launch]
                                                                               │
                                                                  P1 ─► P2 ─► P3
```

- **Stage 0 is the current bottleneck** — Core service and DB schemas don't exist yet, and almost
  every later stage depends on them. Prioritize it.
- **Authorization is deliberately deferred.** Shipping simple membership checks in MVP and full
  ReBAC in P1 is the single biggest scope-saver without hurting the product.
- **Observability is split:** "can I see logs and is it up?" is MVP (Stage 6); tracing/alerting/SLAs
  are P1. Don't let the full o11y epic block launch.
- Stages 5 and 6 can run partly in parallel once Alpha is reached (different surfaces).

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture complexity stalls the product | Thin vertical slice first (Stages 1–4); defer FGA, tracing, multi-repo polish |
| Multi-currency complicates the ledger early | Build the ledger single-currency in Stage 4; add currency in Stage 5 |
| Solo/learning project, unbounded scope | Hard line at "MVP Launch"; everything else is explicitly P1–P3 |
| Free-tier limits on hosting/o11y | Keep MVP footprint small (2 services + 2 DBs); pick OSS-friendly free tiers |

---

## 7. Open Decisions

- **File storage provider** for attachments (Stage 5) — not yet chosen; fold into *FNS-3/102*.
- **Authorization model for MVP** — confirm "membership check in Core" is acceptable vs. a minimal
  FGA integration now.
- **Currency conversion source** — fixed snapshot rate at expense time vs. live FX API.
